"""
Example Lakebase SDK usage (kept as a non-test example under backend/tests).

This file intentionally avoids importing the Databricks SDK so it will not
be executed as part of CI or test collection. If you want runnable examples,
move them into a separate `examples/` or `scripts/` folder and keep them out
of `backend/tests`.
